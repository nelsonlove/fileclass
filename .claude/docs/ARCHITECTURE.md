# Fileclass — Architecture & Implementation Plan

> **Read this file entirely before writing any code.** It encodes decisions and
> runtime-verified facts established during the design phase (July 2026). Do not
> re-litigate the decisions in §2; do not "improve" `src/engine/basesAdapter.ts`
> without re-running its verification protocol (§14).

## 1. What this plugin is

**Fileclass** is the schema and data-quality layer for Obsidian vaults: typed,
validated, per-note-type property schemas ("fileClasses") with guided input and
nested objects — using the **core Bases plugin as query/view engine**. It is the
successor of [Metadata Menu](https://github.com/mdelobelle/metadatamenu)
(same author). Metadata Menu goes into maintenance mode; users relying on
dataview inline fields stay there.

**Out of scope (deliberate):** *computed* fields — **Lookup** (reverse relations)
and **Formula** (computed columns). They don't validate user input; they derive
and write values from *other* notes/fields, which is a different concern and is
better served by Bases views (and, for persistence, other tooling). Fileclass is
the schema + guided-input + nested-editing layer, not a computation engine. See
§9.

Positioning vs core Obsidian:
- core **Properties** types are flat and vault-global; no per-class schema, no
  constrained values, no relations, no nested editing.
- core **Bases** queries/views properties (including nested ones) but cannot
  edit nested values and has no schema.
- **Fileclass** = fileClass schemas (≈ table schema), File/MultiFile fields
  constrained by a Base view (≈ foreign key), Select (≈ enum), Object/ObjectList
  (nested typed structures with a real editor). Reverse relations and computed
  columns are **out of scope** (§9).

## 2. Non-negotiable design decisions

| # | Decision | Consequence |
|---|----------|-------------|
| D1 | **No dataview dependency, ever.** | Query engine = Bases via `src/engine/basesAdapter.ts`. `dvQueryString`/`customRendering`/`customSorting` options from legacy fileClasses are ignored silently (§13). |
| D2 | **Frontmatter-only.** No inline (`key:: value`) fields. | All reads via `metadataCache.getFileCache(f).frontmatter`; all writes via `app.fileManager.processFrontMatter`. No line-level note parsing (Metadata Menu's `note/lineNode` machinery is NOT ported). |
| D3 | **fileClass file format is Metadata Menu's, unchanged.** | Normative reference: `/Users/mdelobel/Obsidian-Dev/.obsidian/plugins/metadatamenu/src/fileClass/fileClass.ts` (+ `fileClassAttribute.ts`). Existing fileClass notes must load as-is (minus D1 options). |
| D4 | **All Bases private-API access lives in `src/engine/basesAdapter.ts`.** | No other module may touch `embedRegistry`, `internalPlugins.getPluginById('bases')`, controllers, datasets. The adapter feature-detects and throws `BasesUnavailableError` with a graceful UI fallback upstream. |
| D5 | **Editing of Object/ObjectList = draft editor.** | Clone value → edit draft in memory → validate against schema → single atomic `processFrontMatter` write. Never write per-subfield. Never regenerate an object from the schema: always mutate the user's object (preserves unknown keys). |
| D6 | **Views = registered custom Bases view** (editable cells), plus auto-generated `.base` files per fileClass. No bespoke table engine (Metadata Menu's `fileClassTableView`/`fileClassDataviewTable` are NOT ported). |
| D7 | Global singleton pattern: `getPlugin()` from `src/globals.ts`. **Never use the bare global `app`** — always `getPlugin().app` or an explicit `App` parameter (adapter functions take `app` explicitly for testability). |
| D8 | Docs and tests are part of each phase's definition of done, not a final phase. |

## 3. Runtime-verified facts (Obsidian 1.13.2, July 2026)

These were verified experimentally against a live Obsidian. They are the
contract the code relies on. If any breaks on a newer Obsidian, the canary
tests (§14) must catch it.

### 3.1 Bases internals (used only inside basesAdapter)
- `app.embedRegistry.embedByExtension['base']` is a factory
  `(context, file, subpath) => embed`; the embed's **constructor creates a
  QueryController** without any workspace leaf. `embed.loadQuery()` =
  `vault.read` + `Query.fromString(yaml)` — pure read, no rendering.
- Never call `controller.setQuery()` headless: it triggers `update()` →
  `runQuery()`, whose loop **suspends until `viewContainerEl.isShown()`**
  (`isShown = !!offsetParent`). Instead assign `controller.query = q` directly.
- `controller.buildBasesContext(viewConfig.filters)` returns a context
  combining base-level and view-level filters (`FilterCls.and`). Entry class is
  reachable via `new (ctx.constructor)(app, null, {}, anyTFile)._local.constructor`.
- Filtering loop (replicating the plugin's own `runQuery`): for each
  `app.vault.getFiles()`, skip `metadataCache.isUserIgnored(path)`, build
  `new Entry(ctx, file)`, keep if `!ctx.filter || ctx.filter.test(entry)`.
  Files whose filter throws are excluded (same as native behavior).
- Sorted/grouped rows: populate `controller.results`, attach a table view from
  `internalPlugins.getPluginById('bases').instance.getViewFactory('table')(controller, controller.viewContainerEl)`,
  set `view.config`, `controller.view = view`, `controller.initialScan = false`
  (notifyView is a no-op otherwise), call `controller.notifyView()` →
  `view.data` is the dataset. **The dataset constructor already applies
  `applySort` + `applyLimit`** (limit is global, applied before grouping).
  `ds.properties` = validated `order:` columns; `ds.groupedData` = groups
  `{entries, key}` (intra-group order = global sort; keyless group last).
- `entry.getValue('note.x' | 'file.x' | 'formula.x')` accepts string
  identifiers. Empty values are a **null-value singleton** (`toString() ===
  'null'`), not JS `null` — detect by identity (probe a nonexistent property).
- **`order:` entries are bare property names, not access expressions** (verified
  via CDP, issue #37). Bases normalizes each entry to a column id: an entry not
  starting with `file.`/`formula.`/`note.` gets `note.` prepended — so `Playing
  style` / `"Test Property"` → `note.Playing style` / `note.Test Property`. A
  `note["Test Property"]` entry is **wrong in `order:`** (Bases re-prefixes it to
  `note.note["Test Property"]`, an empty column) — the bracket form is only for
  filters/formulas. `getValue` resolves `note.Test Property` (and bare `Test
  Property`) but **not** the bracket form. Generate `order:` with the bare name,
  YAML-quoted when needed (`baseYaml.ts` `yamlScalar`); the runtime column id
  stays `note.<name>` (spaces included), which `columns.ts` already handles.
- Bases **formulas/filters traverse nested structures**: `fields[0].name`,
  `note["a"][0]["b"]` work. Dotted *identifiers* (`note.a.0.b`) do NOT traverse
  (taken as a literal key).
- Context file: filters/formulas using `this.file` resolve against
  `controller.currentFile` — set it before `buildBasesContext` for
  embed-context views.
- **In an *embedded* base, `this.file` is the note holding the embed** (measured on
  1.13.2, August 2026): one `.base` embedded in `Host A.md` and `Host B.md` returns
  Host A's rows in the first and Host B's in the second. This is what makes **one**
  reverse-relation view serve every note of a class (#154) instead of one view per
  note.
- **Matching "the note whose link field points at the host"** — verified over CDP
  against three cases: a plain link, an **aliased** link (`[[A1|Melville]]`), and two
  notes sharing a basename in different folders.
  - a `File` field: `author == this.file.asLink()` works, and so do
    `author.asFile() == this.file`, `author.asFile().path == this.file.path` and
    `author.linksTo(this.file)`. All four pass the alias and tell the namesakes apart —
    Bases resolves links on both sides, whether the stored link is a basename or a full
    path;
  - a `MultiFile` field: `contributors.contains(this.file.asLink())` works, as does
    `containsAny`. **`linksTo` and `==` both return nothing on a list.**
  - **`author.contains(this.file.name)` is wrong** and looks right: it matched a second
    note whose link pointed at a *different* file with the same basename. Never compare
    basenames.
  - So the cardinality needs **two expressions**, not one: there is no form that covers
    both (`containsAny` on a scalar `File` returned nothing).
- **What the host asks of a registered view** (traced property by property on the
  object returned by the factory, August 2026):
  - in a **leaf**: `load` → `type` → `focus`, then it *sets* `allProperties` and
    `data` and calls `onDataUpdated()`;
  - in an **embed** (`![[x.base]]` or a ```` ```base ```` block): `load` → `type`,
    and then nothing until the container is shown. `onResize` is called later.
  So `view.type` **is read** (the native views carry it as a field) and a custom
  view should expose the view id.
- **A custom view must fill its container immediately, or an embed deadlocks.**
  Obsidian ships
  `.workspace-leaf-content[data-type="markdown"] .block-language-base .bases-view:empty,
  … .bases-embed .bases-view:empty { display: none }`, and `runQuery` suspends
  until `viewContainerEl.isShown()` (it awaits `onNodeInserted` otherwise, read
  from the minified source). A view that draws nothing before its data arrives is
  therefore hidden, never shown, never fed: measured as "0 results" with
  `display: none` and `isShown() === false` on our container, against `block` on
  the native `table` in the same block. The native views escape it by building
  their skeleton (thead, scroll element) in the constructor. One child element is
  enough — `fileclassTableView` writes a `.fileclass-table-pending` div on `load`
  and whenever it has nothing to render.
- **The toolbar is a sibling of the view container**, not a parent: `.bases-header
  > .bases-toolbar` beside `.bases-view`, both under `.view-content` in a leaf and
  under `.bases-embed` / `.block-language-base` in an embed. Anything injected into
  a toolbar must be scoped to the *closest* of those wrappers — a note holding two
  embedded bases has two toolbars.
- **A rendered table can always name itself**, from one of two places:
  - a leaf states it: `leaf.getViewState().state === {file: "Books.base", viewName:
    "Book"}`;
  - an **embed** states it on the element holding it: `![[Books.base#Book]]` leaves
    `src="Books.base#Book"` (and `alt="Books.base > Book"`) on the `.internal-embed`,
    reachable with `closest("[src]")`. `src` is a **link**, so resolve it with
    `getFirstLinkpathDest`; with no `#`, the rendered view is the one the toolbar
    names.
  That is how a table knows which fileClass declared it (`baseFile`/`baseView`). An
  inline ```` ```base ```` block has no file and no `src`: nothing declares it, so a
  view there falls back to the classes of its rows.
- **The registry exposes views only.** `instance.registrations` holds view types
  (`table`, `cards`, `list`, + ours) and the instance offers `registerView` /
  `deregisterView` / `getViewFactory` — there is **no** hook to contribute a
  computed property or a function, which is why validity cannot become something
  Bases' own Sort/Filter menus see (#142).
- **`property == "X"` does not match a list.** A note carrying several classes
  stores `fileClass` as a YAML list, and equality never matches it (measured: 8
  rows instead of 9). Generated filters use `property.containsAny("X")`, which
  matches the scalar case too.

### 3.2 processFrontMatter (write path)
Verified: **preserves order** of top-level keys, nested object keys, ObjectList
items, and per-item key order (even when inconsistent between items); preserves
block scalars (`|`), value types and necessary quotes. Normalizes: **YAML
comments are deleted**, integer-like keys reordered numerically ("2","1" →
"1","2"), flow lists (`[a, b]`) rewritten as bullet lists, superfluous single
quotes removed. New keys are appended at the end. These normalizations go in
the user docs; the order-preservation claim gets a canary test.

## 5. Schema layer

- fileClass notes live under `settings.classFilesPath`. Frontmatter carries
  `fields` (list of `{name, id, type, options, path}`), `extends`, `excludes`,
  `mapWithTag`, `tagNames`, `filesPaths`, `bookmarksGroups`, `version`, plus
  view options. **Port the parsing semantics from Metadata Menu** (D3), do not
  redesign. `path` encodes nesting (parent field ids joined with `____`).
- Inheritance: single `extends` chain with cycle guard; `excludes` removes
  inherited fields (same as MDM `getFileClassesAncestors`).
- Field options referencing queries change shape: anywhere MDM had
  `dvQueryString`, Fileclass uses `{ baseFile: string, viewName?: string }`
  (a `.base` path + view). Settings UIs offer a base picker + view dropdown
  (views listed via `listBaseViews` from the adapter).

## 6. Query engine rules

- Only `fields/` (File/MultiFile/Media candidates, List value sources) and
  `views/` may call the adapter — always through its public functions:
  `isBasesAvailable`, `listBaseViews`, `getBaseFiles`, `getBaseRows`.
- Every call goes through `queryCache` for the parsed Query when repeated
  (invalidate on `vault.on('modify')` of the `.base` file).
- Each adapter run is O(vault) (entry per file, like native Bases). Never call
  it per-target-file in loops.
- If `isBasesAvailable()` is false (Bases disabled or internals drifted):
  disable query-dependent features with a persistent Notice + settings banner;
  everything else (schema, typed input on scalar fields) keeps working.

## 7. Field types (port waves)

Wave A (phase 2): `Input`, `Number`, `Boolean`, `Select`, `Multi`, `Cycle`,
`Date`, `DateTime`, `Time`.
Wave B (phase 2): `File`, `MultiFile`, `Media`, `MultiMedia` — candidates =
`getBaseRows(baseFile, viewName, currentFile.path)`, so they follow the view's
own order (its `sort:`/`groupBy` flow, not an arbitrary set — issue #47); the
same rows carry the optional alias/display column. When the view groups,
candidates are built from `result.groups` (group order, members contiguous) and
tagged with their group key, and the pickers render group headers (single-pick
suggester + multi-select list). `Select`/`Multi` values from a base use
`getBaseRows` too (order only). Pure row→display/value/group mapping lives in
`src/fields/baseOrder.ts` (unit-tested); the order itself is canary-verified.
Wave C (phase 2): `Object`, `ObjectList` (§8).
Wave D (post-P3): `JSON`, `YAML` — free-form nested value edited as monospace
text, validated by the parser (`JSON.parse` / Obsidian `parseYaml`). Pure
serialize/parse in `src/fields/structuredText.ts` with an injected YAML codec;
the escape hatch for structures Object/ObjectList don't model.
Out of scope: `Lookup`, `Formula` — computed types, not validated input (§9).
Legacy fileClasses may still declare them: they parse and display read-only, but
have no input, no settings UI, and are not offered when authoring a fileClass.
Planned (dedicated feature, §9.1): `Canvas`, `CanvasGroup`, `CanvasGroupLink`.

**Required (landed):** a common `required` flag on any field's options (schema
editor toggle, `src/ui/fieldDefModal.ts`). Empty values stay valid *unless*
`required` is set — `isRequired`/`validateField` (`src/fields/validate.ts`)
report a violation for an empty required field. Enforced uniformly: the
validation columns (§11), the API/CLI `validate`, and every write path.

Each field module ships: options settings UI, value input modal/suggester,
`validate(value, options)`, cell renderer for the custom view, doc page, unit
tests for the validator.

### 7.1 Proposed new field types (design discussion, July 2026)

Seven proposals filed as issues on `mdelobelle/fileclass` after triaging
Metadata Menu's open field-type requests (mm = metadatamenu issue). All respect
the field contract above: a typed scalar/structured value with guided input +
validation, frontmatter-only, no computation (§9). **None is scheduled into a
delivery phase yet** — these record the accepted design so the eventual
implementation doesn't re-litigate it.

| Type / change | Issue | Storage | Dep | Key decisions |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `template` **option** on `Input` | #27 (mm #304) | scalar (rendered string) | — | Port MDM's `options.template`: placeholders `{{name}}` → text sub-input, `{{name:["a","b"]}}` → dropdown, live "Result preview". An **option, not a new type**. **Implemented** (`src/fields/inputTemplate.ts` pure parser/renderer; `TemplateInputModal` in `valueModals.ts`; Input case in `optionsDraft`/`fieldOptionsSettings`/`fieldActions`; `inputTemplate()` accessor in `options.ts`). |
| `MultiInput` type | #28 (mm #547) | YAML list | — | Multi-cardinality Input that **reuses** the `template` option. **Depends on #27.** Convention-consistent with `File`/`MultiFile`. **Implemented**: added to `FIELD_TYPES`/`LIST_TYPES`/`SUPPORTED_INPUT_TYPES`; `MultiInputEditorModal` (add/remove/reorder, delegates each item to `TemplateInputModal`/`PromptModal`) in `valueModals.ts`; reuses Input's template option in `optionsDraft`/`fieldOptionsSettings`; `validateField` requires a list of scalar items; blank items dropped on save. |
| ~~`Recurrence` type~~ | #29 — **DROPPED** | — | — | **Not shipped** (issue #29 closed *not planned*). RFC 5545 RRULE + `rrule` dep was overkill for the only real use case (spaced-repetition date advancing). Superseded by the `Duration`/`CycleDuration` cycling below — same workflow, **zero dep**. Kept here as the record of why. |
| `Duration` type | #30 (mm #751) | RFC 5545 `DURATION` scalar | — (**zero dep**) | **Implemented** without `moment`: the DURATION grammar is small enough to parse/build with a regex and UTC Date math (`src/fields/duration.ts`, pure & unit-tested). Builder (`DurationInputModal`) has W/D/H/M/S spinners; weeks stay standalone (`P2W`) else fold into days (`P{d}DT…`) to stay RFC-valid. Compact human preview (`1d 6h`). `validateField` uses the pure `isValidDuration`. |
| `CycleDuration` type | (folds #29's workflow into #30) | YAML list of DURATIONs | — | The list counterpart of `Duration` (ordered interval sequence stored in the note). `CycleDurationEditorModal` add/remove/reorder, each item via `DurationInputModal`. **Drives the spaced-repetition mechanic**: a Date/DateTime field's option `nextIntervalField` names a `Duration`/`CycleDuration` field; the date editor's **"Set next date"** button computes `current + head interval`, writes it, and for a CycleDuration **rotates the list head→tail** (wraps after the last) — one immediate `processFrontMatter` write (`nextDateProvider` in `fieldActions`). Not Formula/Lookup: manual, single-note, no auto-recompute. Both `Duration` and `CycleDuration` accept **free-text** value entry (ISO or human `1h 30m`, `parseDurationInput`) synced with W/D/H/M/S spinners, and an optional schema **`presets`** list surfaced as quick picks (one-click button / tap-to-append chips); values stay per-note. Named `CycleDuration` (not `MultiDuration`) because order + rotation are its essence, echoing the `Cycle` family. |
| `Location` type | #31 | `"lat,lon"` scalar | — | Matches the core **Bases Map view** text format. **Implemented** (`src/fields/location.ts` pure parse/validate/format/`mapUrl`; `LocationInputModal`): two range-validated number inputs (lat ∈ ±90, lon ∈ ±180) + paste + an "Open in map" external browser link. **No embedded map picker** — external tiles = network, against no-external-dep and Obsidian review guidelines. An in-app OSM `<webview>` picker was prototyped on request and **reverted**: the Electron `<webview>` tag (deprecated, especially in a popout window) **crashed Obsidian**. Lesson recorded: do not use `<webview>`; keyboard/paste + an external link is the safe, cross-platform, store-compliant path. |
| `Icon` type | #32 | bare icon id scalar | — (`getIconIds`/`setIcon`) | Select over an **extensible icon-bank provider registry** (Lucide first), field option `iconSource`. The bank is a **picker concern, not storage**: Obsidian's registry is global with unique ids, so storage stays the bare id ⇒ Bases-Map `icon` interop. Generalizes the fileClass-icon picker (§20.1). Rejected "one type per bank". **Implemented**: `src/fields/icon.ts` pure (`normalizeIconId` strips `lucide-`, `isPlausibleIconId` for the pure structural validator — the real "is registered" check is a picker/display concern); `iconPicker.ts` = `ICON_SOURCES` registry + `iconIdsForSource` (`getIconIds()` filtered/normalized) + `IconPickerModal` (searchable grid, previews via `paintIcon`, capped at 240 rendered); `iconSource` option in `options`/`optionsDraft`/`fieldOptionsSettings`. Reuses existing `iconSuggest.paintIcon`. No `<webview>`, core APIs only. |
| `Color` type | #33 | CSS color scalar | — (native `<input type=color>`) | Same **palette-source provider** pattern as Icon: default = canvas palette, option `colorSource`, + custom color. Storage stays a raw CSS value ⇒ Bases-Map `color` interop. **Implemented**: `src/fields/color.ts` pure `isValidCssColor` (hex / rgb()/hsl() / the standard CSS named-color set) for the pure validator; `colorPicker.ts` = `COLOR_SOURCES` registry (canvas palette) + `ColorPickerModal` (full-opacity `fileclass-swatch` chips reusing `fileclass-color-chip`, native color input + free-text CSS value synced, clear); `colorSource` option in `options`/`optionsDraft`/`fieldOptionsSettings`. No dependency, no `<webview>`. |

**Bases Map view interop (decided):** Fileclass **does not generate map views**.
If a user names fields `coordinates` / `icon` / `color`, the core Bases Map view
picks them up on its own; otherwise the note is simply absent from it. The
`Location`/`Icon`/`Color` types only make those properties easy to enter
correctly. View generation is out of the plugin's purpose.

**Rejected as out of scope** (mm requests that violate §9): AI Field (mm #607 —
computed via LLM + queries), Relationship/reverse-lookup combo (mm #222 =
Lookup), classes-as-fields / UML aggregation (mm #611 = Lookup). **Better as
options on existing types, not new types:** email/format on `Input` (mm #197),
label≠value on `Select` (mm #341), link-to-nonexistent on `File` (mm #193).

## 8. Object / ObjectList

- `objectPath.ts`: `parsePath("fields[0].name") → ["fields", 0, "name"]`,
  `get/set/insert/remove`. Path syntax deliberately matches Bases formula
  syntax (§3.1). ~50 lines, zero Obsidian imports, fully unit-tested.
- Draft editor (D5): recursive modal driven by the schema. Add/remove/reorder
  ObjectList items. `Cancel` = no write ever happened. `Save` = full-draft
  validation, then one `processFrontMatter` write of the mutated clone.
- Reading nested values for display/index: `get(frontmatter, path)` — no file
  parsing.

## 9. Computed fields — out of scope

**Decision (July 2026):** `Lookup` (reverse relations) and `Formula` (computed
columns) are **not** part of Fileclass. Rationale:

- They are not field **validation/input** — Fileclass's job is a typed schema
  with guided input and nested editing. Lookup/Formula instead *derive* a value
  from *other* notes/fields and write it back; that is a distinct concern (a
  computation/automation engine), with its own recalc, status, and dependency
  problems.
- The reading side is already well served by **Bases views** (aggregations,
  reverse links, formula columns) without persisting anything. Persisting derived
  values, when needed, is better handled by dedicated tooling than bolted onto a
  schema layer.
- Evaluating a Bases *formula expression* headless requires fragile, unstable
  private internals (formula compilation / query-cache side effects observed
  during prototyping) — a poor cost/benefit for this plugin.

**Consequences:** no `computed/` module, no Lookup/Formula input, settings, recalc,
commands, or status. Legacy fileClasses declaring such fields still load: the
field parses and its value displays read-only (never coerced, never crashed), but
it is inert and not offered when authoring a fileClass (§7).

### 9.1 Canvas fields — planned, NOT the same as computed fields

`Canvas`, `CanvasGroup`, `CanvasGroupLink` were initially lumped with
Lookup/Formula; a code analysis of MDM showed they are a **different mechanism**
and the two exclusion reasons above do **not** apply:

| Axis | Lookup / Formula | Canvas* |
|------|------------------|---------|
| Source | user DataviewJS query / JS expression | native `.canvas` file (JSON graph) |
| External dependency | **Dataview (hard)** | **none** (`obsidian/canvas` + `vault.read`) |
| Logic | open-ended, user-authored | **fixed**: `canvasPath` + direction / group |
| Trigger | `dataview:metadata-change` (any metadata) | `vault.on("modify")` on a `.canvas` (narrow) |
| Bases equivalent | **yes** (reverse links, formula columns) | **no** — Bases doesn't index canvas adjacency |

So excluding Lookup/Formula loses nothing (Bases covers it, and they need the
rejected Dataview dep, D1). Excluding Canvas* loses a capability **with no
substitute**. Decision: **implement** as a dedicated feature (chosen over
out-of-scope), scheduled **after JSON/YAML**.

**Implemented** (`src/fields/canvas/`): a small canvas→frontmatter sync, no Dataview:
- pure `canvasGraph.ts` — parse + traversal (oriented edges, color/side/label
  filters, geometric group membership); fully unit-tested;
- `canvasEngine.ts` — a Component watching `.canvas` via
  `vault.on("modify"|"create"|"delete"|"rename")` (debounced) and re-syncing on
  the index event; parses the canvas, computes each note's Canvas-family field
  values, **diffs vs current** (writes only on change → no loop), writes with the
  single-write path (D5), and clears fields on notes that dropped out
  (`lastNotes` map, like MDM's `canvasLastFiles`);
- options `canvasPath` + `direction` in the schema editor (advanced
  color/side/label filters preserved and honored if present);
- gated by the **enableCanvasEngine** setting (it auto-writes frontmatter, the
  one surface that does).

## 10. Index

Slim rewrite of MDM's `FieldIndex` keeping ONLY:
- fileClass registry (parse all notes under `classFilesPath`), ancestors, fields
  per fileClass;
- file → fileClass mapping with MDM's priority order: frontmatter alias >
  tag match > path match > bookmark group match > (base-view match, replaces
  fileClassQueries) > global fileClass > preset fields;
- rebuild on `metadataCache.on('resolved')` (debounced) and on fileClass file
  changes; `metadata-menu:indexed`-style event renamed `fileclass:indexed`.

Dropped entirely: dataview listeners, `dVRelatedFieldsToUpdate`, IndexedDB
(`src/db`), ExistingField location index (frontmatter reads are direct),
canvas file tracking (comes with the planned Canvas engine, §9.1).

## 11. Views

- `registerFileclassView` (adapter): register view id `fileclass-table` on the bases plugin
  instance (`instance.registerView(id, {name: "Fileclass table", icon, factory})`,
  observed shape `{name, icon, factory(controller, containerEl), options}`).
  The factory builds a table on `view.data` (dataset) where each cell is
  editable through the field managers (schema known via the resolver). This
  replaces Metadata Menu's FileClassView **and keeps in-cell editing**.
  Registration/deregistration on plugin load/unload; feature-detect like D4
  (this is adapter territory: expose `registerFileclassView(app, spec)` from
  basesAdapter).
- **Validation columns (landed):** the `fileclass-table` view can prepend a
  `valid` (✓/✗) column and append an `errors` column, validating **all** of each
  note's root fields (not just shown columns) via `validateField`; allowed values
  are resolved once per render and cached. Gated by
  `settings.enableValidationColumns` (default on).
- `baseFileGenerator`: command "Create base for fileClass" → writes
  `<basesFolder>/<FileClass>.base` with one `fileclass-table` view whose
  `order:` = the fileClass fields and whose **view-level** `filters:` is
  `<alias> == "X"` (respect `settings.fileClassAlias`). Never overwrite an
  existing file without confirmation.
- **View-level fileClass filter (issue #55):** the class filter lives on the
  managed view, not base-wide, so a base can host extra views for other
  fileClasses (a `bookAuthor` view in the `book` base) without them being
  shadowed. Bases ANDs base-level and view-level filters, so a view-level filter
  is equivalent for the managed view (§3.1). Migration-safe: `buildBaseYaml`
  emits view-level for **new** bases; `mirrorBaseView` adds the view-level filter
  only when it **creates** the managed view, and **never touches an existing
  view's filters** — legacy base-wide filters are preserved as-is (no silent
  migration). Sync/regenerate never pushes a per-view scope back to base-wide.
  Anchored by a unit test (two fileClasses, two views survive a re-sync) and the
  e2e `two-fileclasses.base` fixture.
- Embeds: users embed bases natively — `![[Some.base]]` or a ```` ```base ````
  block; no custom code block of ours. An embedded `fileclass-table` is the same
  view: editable cells, validation columns, and the *Manage `<FileClass>`* wrench,
  each scoped to its own embed. See §3.1 for the two rules an embed enforces that a
  leaf does not (fill the container, expose `type`).
- **The class ↔ view link** (`baseFile`/`baseView` on the class note) is what names
  the table: `Books.base › Book` is Book's view even when a row carries several
  classes. It is also a uniqueness constraint — two classes mirroring into one view
  would overwrite each other's `order:` on every sync, so the generator and the
  options editor refuse it, naming the class that claimed it first
  (`fileClassClaimingView`).
- **A group cell shows the field's own display** (#156): `Object`/`ObjectList` cells
  render through `describeField`, not Bases' `toString()` — same string as the
  note-fields modal, the property buttons and the API, so the value displayed and the
  value edited agree. Every other type keeps Bases' value, which knows about formulas,
  file properties and link rendering. Deps are built once per render, per note.
- **The `valid` column filters on itself** (#142): its header cycles all → failures
  → clean and carries the failure count. Session-only state, never written to the
  base — and the only route available, since the registry takes no computed
  properties (§3.1).

### 11.1 Reverse relations (#154, `reverseView.ts` / `reverseSync.ts`)

The relation a bound link field declares, read from the other end: from an author,
the books whose `author` points at it. Fileclass **authors a view and embeds it**;
Bases evaluates the filter and nothing is stored (§9 stands).

- **One view per relation, not per note.** `this.file` in an embedded base is the
  note holding the embed (measured, §3.1), so `Book by author` answers for every
  author. Reuse is recognition by **name**, and a reused view is never touched —
  columns, sort and filters included, the same restraint `mirrorBaseView` shows.
- **The reader picks the base**, once: `pickReverseBase` offers the class's own base
  (else `<basesFolder><Class>.base`) and takes any path. So the view's home is *not*
  derivable from the class, and `locateReverseView` searches every `.base` in the
  vault by view name — otherwise the second note would create a second copy
  elsewhere and one view would stop serving every note. Asked only on the run that
  creates it; asking again would invite exactly that duplicate.
- **The filter** is the class's own scope (`fileClassViewFilter`, so folder- and
  tag-bound notes stay in) plus one clause: `author == this.file.asLink()`, or
  `contributors.contains(this.file.asLink())` for a list. Two expressions, because
  no single one covers both cardinalities (§3.1). **Never** compare basenames.
- **Columns** come from the class's managed view — read from the **class's** base,
  not from the file being written, so a view sent to a dashboard base still looks
  like the table the reader curated — else the full field mirror; minus the pointing
  field, which holds the host on every row of a reverse table.
- **Discovery** asks each source view whether the host is among its candidates,
  memoised per `(baseFile, viewName)` in `QueryCache`. It runs **on invocation
  only** (§6: each pass is O(vault)). Root fields with a base binding only: an
  unbound link field would make every class a candidate from every note, and a
  `Select` holding a name is not a relation.
- **Writing into a note's body** is the plugin's one write outside
  `processFrontMatter`: at the cursor when the editor is open in source mode, else
  appended. An existing embed is jumped to, never duplicated and never rewritten.
- Fixture `demo/901_reverse_relation` re-verifies the whole chain after an Obsidian
  upgrade: `demo/reverse-probe.mjs` (plain link, aliased link, namesake in another
  folder, reuse by the second author) and `demo/reverse-elsewhere.mjs` (the view sent
  to a base of the reader's choosing, then found there by the next note).

## 12. Public API + CLI/TUI

**Goal:** a JSON-serializable public surface reusable from Obsidian's own CLI
(`obsidian eval "…"`, which runs JS in the live app — reachability + JSON
round-trip verified) and a future standalone `fileclass` CLI/TUI wrapper. Not a
one-to-one port of Metadata Menu's `plugin.api`.

**API-1 (landed):** `src/api/fileclassApi.ts` → `createFileclassApi(plugin)`,
exposed as `plugin.api` (`app.plugins.plugins.fileclass.api`, `version` now "1.1").
Thin wiring over the existing engine (index, `validateField`, `io/read`+`write`,
`resolveFieldValues`, `describeField`, `insertMissingFields`), JSON in/out,
non-interactive (`setValue` validates then writes — strict list membership, no
modal), structured `WriteResult`s. Surface: `listFileClasses`, `getSchema`,
`explain`, `getFields`, `getValue`, `allowedValues`, `validate(scope?)` (empty
scope = whole vault), `setValue`, `clearValue`, `insertMissing`. Obsidian-coupled
→ verified live via CDP rather than unit-tested (the wired core is unit-tested).

**API-2 (landed):** `listNotes(fileClass, { columns?, where?, limit? })` and
`setValueWhere(fileClass, field, value, where?)` — bulk over a fileClass's notes.
The filter predicate is pure (`src/api/filter.ts`, unit-tested): `is`/`isNot`
(string compare), `contains` (case-insensitive substring, per array element), `isEmpty`/
`isNotEmpty`. `setValueWhere` validates each write (strict), skips no-ops, and
aggregates a `BulkResult`. Verified live via CDP (no-op and out-of-list bulk both
wrote nothing).

**API-2.1 (landed, `version` "1.1"):** `previewValueWhere(scope, field, value)`,
`applyValueWhere(scope, field, value)`, and `applyValueToPaths(paths, field,
value)` over a `BulkScope` (`{ fileClass, where?, baseFile?, viewName? }`). A
single per-note `decide` (validate + no-op check) drives all three, so the
dry-run and the writes agree. `previewValueWhere` returns a `BulkPreview` — the
**full** `changes: {path,from,to}[]` list plus `willSkip`/`errors`, no writes; a
base-view filter intersects the fileClass's notes with `getBaseFiles` and is
refused (not silently unfiltered) when Bases is off. `applyValueToPaths` writes
just the paths the user kept. `setValueWhere` delegates to `applyValueWhere`.
`contains` is a case-insensitive substring per array element, like `ILIKE
'%value%'` (`[[Comic]]` matches `comic`, `src/api/filter.ts`, unit-tested). The in-app **bulk edit** flow
(`src/ui/bulkEditModal.ts`, command + fileClass right-click, §19.3) is two
modals: a form (fileClass → filter → field → value via the field's own typed
input, CTA Preview) then a full change list with per-note toggles (CTA Apply(N)
→ `applyValueToPaths`). Obsidian-coupled → manual/CDP verified (the `where`
filter stays unit-tested).

**CLI/TUI (landed, separate repo):** a standalone `fileclass` binary (Node +
React/ink) shelling out to `obsidian eval` via a small transport, over the same
API. It lives in its **own repository** — `mdelobelle/fileclass-cli` — NOT in
this plugin repo: it uses Node built-ins (fs/os/path/child_process) that the
Obsidian plugin review linter (rightly) rejects for a mobile-capable plugin
bundle, and it is never part of what Obsidian downloads. Commands: `fileclasses`,
`schema`, `explain`,
`list`, `get`, `set`, `validate` (exit 1 on any violation — CI-friendly),
dry-run-by-default `set-where`, plus `tui` (interactive browse + typed editing +
inline validation status). Vault targeting: `--vault` > `FILECLASS_VAULT` >
`fileclass use` persisted default (`~/.config/fileclass/config.json`) > active
vault; every command echoes `vault: <name>` to stderr. `--json` on any command.
Obsidian-coupled → verified live rather than unit-tested (the pure `where` filter
and formatting helpers are unit-tested).

**Next (optional):** a schema-authoring API and a no-app CI mode.

## 13. Legacy fileClass options

No migration tooling ships, and the once-considered **audit command is dropped**
(decision July 2026): users migrated their fileClass **format** to Metadata
Menu's current schema long ago. The only remnant is dataview-era *option* keys
(`dvQueryString` / `customRendering` / `customSorting` / `customListFunction` /
`customSummarizingFunction` / fileClassQueries). Per D1 these are **ignored
silently** and never crash the index (§17); new link fields use
`{ baseFile, viewName }` instead.

The processFrontMatter normalizations (§3.2) are documented for users in the
fields/user docs (first-write warning), not in a migration guide.

## 14. Testing

- **Unit (vitest, no Obsidian)**: objectPath, schema resolver (inheritance,
  excludes, binding priorities), field validators, draft editor logic. Run in CI
  on every push.
- **E2E (CDP)**: harness from `~/obsidian-bases-probe/cdp.js` pattern — a Node
  script connects to a dev Obsidian (`--remote-debugging-port=9222`) opened on
  `tests/e2e/fixture-vault/`, drives the plugin via `Runtime.evaluate`, asserts
  on vault file contents. Scenarios: each field type write, draft editor
  atomicity, base generation.
- **Canary tests** (run at every Obsidian upgrade, part of e2e): (1) the
  basesAdapter verification protocol — a known fixture `.base` returns the
  expected file set and sorted/grouped rows; (2) processFrontMatter
  order-preservation (§3.2). If a canary fails on a new Obsidian version,
  `basesAdapter` is the only file expected to change.

### 14.1 Planned: the demo harness as the e2e runner

**Status: designed, not built** (decided 2026-08-04, deferred). Nothing below
exists yet; `tests/e2e/canary.mjs` and `demo/` are what exist.

**Why.** Every defect found in the week of 0.2.2 → 0.2.5 lived in the *glue* with
Obsidian, where 467 unit tests are blind by construction: a Properties row
recycled onto another note (a control writing to the wrong note — silent for a
`Cycle`), a name-only de-duplication dropping a child field, an item pushed into
a draft before its editor opened. Each was found by playing the surface by hand
before filming it — 13 fix commits attribute themselves to that pass, against 3
to a user report. The pass is the most productive quality instrument in the
project and the least durable: it lives in a person's hands.

Meanwhile the two halves of an automated version already exist apart:

| Exists | Missing |
|--------|---------|
| `tests/e2e/canary.mjs` — assertions, exit codes (0 / 1 / 2), a dependency-free CDP client | it asks a human to launch Obsidian, open the vault and enable the plugins |
| `demo/lib/stage.mjs` + `probe.mjs` — stage a vault, launch with the debug port, accept the trust prompt, wait for the plugin, wipe and restore the vault registry in a `finally` | it has no notion of failure: a probe prints, it does not assert |

So the work is a marriage, not a construction.

**1. Runner.** `tests/e2e/run.mjs` takes `probe.mjs`'s lifecycle and serves specs
with it. A spec declares the vault it needs — a demo fixture by number, or a
purpose-built one — and the runner **groups specs by vault** so Obsidian is
launched once per group (~15 s, the only real cost). `npm run test:e2e` then runs
with no human hands.

**2. Driving vocabulary.** One file of helpers, everything the manual passes do:
open a note, run a command, read a note's frontmatter, click a row's action *by
its accessible name*, type, press, read the top modal. Plus the `waitUntil` the
probes lack — they wait with `sleep`, which is the obvious flakiness source.
One measured trap: **Obsidian menus ignore a DOM `.click()`** (the Bases view
switcher did, 2026-08-03); they need CDP Input events at coordinates, because
they listen for trusted events only.

**3. First specs — one per defect of that week**, the first being the one that
matters: *clicking a control on note B writes B and leaves A byte-identical*.
Then the phantom item, a child homonym of a root field offered when adding an
item, a stray value kept, the warning colour rule, one write per action with key
order preserved — and *a suggestion in a picker opened over a modal can be
clicked*, which is the shape of bug CSS regressions take: unit tests cannot see
it, and it takes a real click to find.

**4. A free sweep.** The 24 demo fixtures are 24 known, coherent states: opening
each and asserting that the index resolves every class and that **every declared
child is reachable** would have caught the homonym bug the day take 021's fixture
existed, with no dedicated test written.

**Rules that keep it affordable.**

- **Assert on data, never on pixels** — frontmatter, the index, the untouched
  neighbour file. Confine the DOM to the helper file, so an Obsidian update moves
  one file.
- **No test hook to reach what the OS forbids** (native colour popover, file
  dialogs, real drag). Testing through the API would stop testing the wiring, and
  the wiring is where every one of these bugs lived. The run **prints what it did
  not attempt** instead: a suite that skips in silence is worse than an absent
  one.
- **Don't duplicate the unit suite**: only the glue — recycled rows, modal
  lifecycles, index resolution after a write.
- **Not CI, at first.** Obsidian under xvfb is feasible but is a maintenance
  post. The right framing is not "coverage in CI" but *the gate run before every
  tag*.
- Demo scenarios stay narrative; only their **fixtures** and the stage machinery
  are shared.

## 15. Delivery phases (each = code + unit tests + doc page)

- **P0 Foundations**: scaffold following the official
  [obsidian-sample-plugin](https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-sample-plugin)
  conventions — replicate its files (manifest.json, versions.json,
  version-bump.mjs, esbuild.config.mjs, release workflow, .gitignore for
  build artifacts), do NOT clone the repo (this repo already has its own
  history). Deviations from the template: full `strict` tsconfig, vitest,
  code under `src/` with a thin root `main.ts`. Then: globals,
  objectPath, queryCache, adapter wired with feature detection, e2e harness
  skeleton + canary tests, Hugo docs skeleton with positioning page.
- **P1 Schema (read-only)**: fileClass parsing, inheritance, resolver/index,
  "fileclass:indexed" event, fileClass chooser UI.
- **P2 Fields & input**: waves A→C, `io/write`, insert-missing-fields command,
  field options menus, draft editor.
- **P2-bis Field UI surfaces** (§19): reach editing from the UI, not just
  commands. Three slices — (1) note-fields modal + file/editor context menus;
  (2) field indicator in tab header, file explorer, bookmarks; (3) indicator on
  internal links (reading + live preview + backlinks) and the Bases first
  column. All editing reuses the P2 dispatcher; the DOM-injection layer is
  isolated and feature-flagged per surface.
- **P2-ter fileClass schema editor** (§20): author a fileClass's own definition
  (options + field definitions), the write-side counterpart of P1's read-only
  schema and the home of the deferred per-type "options settings UI" (§7).
  Modal-based (no dedicated view). Three slices — (1) options editor + add/
  remove/reorder fields; (2) per-type option settings (Number/Date/Boolean,
  Select/Cycle/Multi with base-picker); (3) File/Media + Object/ObjectList.
- **P3 Views**: base file generator + explicit base sync (done, §11); then the
  fileclass-table custom Bases view with editable cells + validation columns.
  *(Computed fields — Lookup/Formula — are out of scope; see §9.)*
- **P4 Terminal (landed)**: public API (API-1 + API-2), the `fileclass` CLI, and
  the ink TUI (§12); `required` fields + validation columns (§7, §11). No
  migration tooling (§13).

## 16. Coding conventions

- TypeScript strict; **no `any` anywhere** — the Obsidian review linter forbids
  it (and disabling the rule). Private Bases/Obsidian internals are reached only
  in `src/engine/basesAdapter.ts`, structurally typed via `unknown` casts to
  minimal interfaces (`AppInternals`, `BasesInstance`, …).
- `getPlugin()` singleton (D7); adapter and objectPath take explicit params
  (pure, testable).
- No new dependency without necessity; UI built on obsidian API primitives.
- English for code, comments, docs. Conventional commits.
- Every thrown error visible to users goes through a `Notice` with actionable
  wording.

## 17. Known risks

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Bases internals drift on Obsidian update | D4 isolation + canary tests; only basesAdapter changes; graceful degradation path |
| O(vault) per query run on huge vaults | queryCache, debounced reads; benchmark fixture in e2e |
| Defects in the glue with Obsidian, invisible to unit tests | the pre-filming surfaces pass finds them today, by hand; automating it is designed in §14.1 — until then the pass is a person's habit, not a gate |
| Users with YAML comments / custom formatting | documented normalization (§3.2), first-write warning in user docs |
| Legacy fileClasses with dv options | options ignored silently (never crash on them, §13) |
| DOM-injected indicators drift on Obsidian update (§19) | isolate the injection layer; per-surface settings flags; defensive selectors that no-op on a miss; core features (modal, menus, commands) never depend on it |

## 18. Reference material

- Metadata Menu source (normative for fileClass format & UX to port):
  `/Users/mdelobel/Obsidian-Dev/.obsidian/plugins/metadatamenu/`
- Bases headless investigation (findings + proven scripts):
  `~/obsidian-bases-probe/findings.md`, `getBaseFiles.inapp.js`,
  `getBaseRows.inapp.js`, `getBaseRows.cdp.js` (CDP harness example: `cdp.js`)
- Dev vault with real fileClasses and `.base` files for manual testing:
  `/Users/mdelobel/Obsidian-Dev` (bases under `Settings/bases/`, fileClasses
  under `Settings/fileClasses/`)

## 19. Field UI surfaces (P2-bis)

Ports Metadata Menu's in-UI editing entry points (`src/components/ExtraButton.ts`,
`ContextMenu.ts`, `src/options/OptionsList.ts`, `linkAttributes.ts`) onto the P2
frontmatter engine. **No new write paths**: every edit routes through the P2
dispatcher (`promptFieldValue`/`updateField`, one `processFrontMatter` write, D5).

### 19.1 Note-fields modal (`src/ui/noteFieldsModal.ts`)
- The single hub for a file's fields: lists the note's resolved **root** fields
  (`index.getFields`), each row = name + current value (`displayValue`) + **Edit**
  (→ `updateField`) + **Clear** (→ `clearField`). Header actions: **Add
  fileClass**, **Insert missing fields**. Nested fields are reached via their
  parent's Object/ObjectList editor (already built in P2 Wave C).
- Opened from every surface below and from a command
  (`fileclass:manage-note-fields`).

### 19.2 Single-property modifier
- "The button to modify a property" = the per-row **Edit** in 19.1, plus a
  direct path: a `fileclass:update-field` already exists (P2). Injecting a button
  into Obsidian's **core Properties widget** is a stretch goal (fragile, §19.5);
  the modal + menus cover the need without it.

### 19.3 Context menus (`src/ui/contextMenu.ts`)
- Register `file-menu` and `editor-menu` (MDM parity). Items: **Manage note
  fields** (→ 19.1), **Add fileClass**, **Insert missing fields**, **Update a
  field** (→ `pickAndUpdateField`). For a fileClass note: a **Manage fields
  schema** entry (wired when the schema editor lands).
- Covers file-explorer right-click, tab right-click, and the editor. Internal-
  link right-click support depends on Obsidian firing `file-menu` for links —
  verify at build time; otherwise the link indicator (19.4) is the entry point.

### 19.4 Field indicator (`src/ui/indicator/`) — the fragile boundary

**Surfaces that re-render need watching, not decorating once.** Reading view goes through the
markdown post-processor; Live Preview is a CodeMirror extension; the backlinks pane, Bases views
and **canvas** leaves are plain DOM that Obsidian rebuilds on its own schedule — a canvas every
time its file is written. Those are handled by `watch(viewType)`: a MutationObserver per leaf,
debounced, re-decorating what came back. A surface decorated once and not watched loses its icons
at the first re-render, silently (measured on the schema canvas: three icons, then none after a
resync).

- A small clickable icon injected next to a file's name that opens 19.1 for that
  file. **Default: icon only** (no values shown) — the lightest, most robust
  option; showing configured field values beside it (MDM's "extra attributes")
  is a later opt-in. Surfaces requested: **tab header, file explorer, bookmark
  explorer, internal links** (reading view + Live Preview + backlinks), and the
  **Bases first column** (`.internal-link` cells, as MDM already does for
  `bases`).
- Implementation mirrors MDM `ExtraButton`: per-view-type **MutationObservers**
  (`.nav-file-title-content` for explorer/bookmarks, `.internal-link` for
  markdown/bases/backlinks), a **markdown post-processor** for reading view, and
  an **editor extension** for Live Preview links. Updates are debounced and keyed
  off `fileclass:indexed` + `metadataCache.on('changed')`.
- **Isolation like the adapter (D4-style)**: all DOM injection lives under
  `src/ui/indicator/`; observers are registered via `register*` and torn down on
  unload; a missed selector no-ops (never throws). Each surface has a settings
  flag (`enableTabHeader`, `enableFileExplorer`, `enableBookmarks`,
  `enableInlineLinks`, `enableBacklinks`, `enableBases`), all default-off-safe.
- The future `fileclass-table` custom view (P4) renders the indicator natively —
  no observer needed there; the `.internal-link` observer covers **native** Bases
  tables.

### 19.5 Slices & DoD
- **P2-bis.1** — note-fields modal + context menus + settings flags. Low-risk,
  high-value; unit tests for the pure "which fields / how displayed" logic.
- **P2-bis.2** — indicator in tab header, file explorer, bookmarks.
- **P2-bis.3** — indicator on internal links (reading + Live Preview +
  backlinks) and the Bases first column.
- Each slice = code + tests (pure logic units; DOM injection verified via the
  e2e/CDP harness or manual on the dev vault) + a doc page. The indicator layer
  is a known-fragile boundary (§17): if a surface breaks on a new Obsidian, only
  its module changes and the core (modal, menus, commands) keeps working.

### 19.6 Property editor buttons (`src/ui/propertyEditButtons.ts`)
An edit button injected between the key and value of each native Properties row
whose key (case-insensitively) is an editable root field of the note's fileClass;
clicking opens `updateField` (typed input + validation). No Obsidian API exists
for this (`metadataTypeManager.registeredTypeWidgets` is per-property-*type*
value rendering, global and private — not per-field) — so it's DOM injection,
same fragile-boundary treatment as the indicators (§19.4): MutationObservers on
markdown/file-properties leaves, dedup-guarded, behind the enablePropertyEditButtons
setting, removed on unload. Canvas cards are skipped (row not in a real
properties editor); auto-maintained (Canvas) and computed types get no button.

## 20. fileClass schema editor (P2-ter)

Authoring the fileClass itself — the write-side counterpart of P1's read-only
parsing (§5) — ported from Metadata Menu's `fileClassSettingsView` and
`fileClassFieldsView`. **Modal-based** (no dedicated leaf view): lighter, and it
reuses the P2 modal/suggester infra. Every change is written to the fileClass
note's frontmatter through a single `processFrontMatter` (D2/D5); after each
write the index rebuilds and fires `fileclass:indexed`.

### 20.1 fileClass options editor (`src/settings/fileClassEditor.ts`)
- A modal editing a fileClass's options: `limit`, `icon` (Lucide picker),
  `extends` (parent — a fileClass suggester with cycle guard), `excludes`,
  `mapWithTag`, `tagNames`, `filesPaths`, `bookmarksGroups`, `fieldsOrder`.
  Mirrors MDM `updateOptions`; writes only the option keys, preserving `fields`.

### 20.2 fileClass fields manager
- Lists the fileClass's **own** fields (inherited ones shown read-only, from the
  parent). Add / edit / remove / reorder field **definitions** (name, id, type,
  options, path). Reorder maintains a clean hierarchy for nested fields
  (`buildSortedAttributes`/`moveField` semantics). Ids are generated for new
  fields; edits mutate the matching `fields[]` entry via processFrontMatter
  (never regenerate the array — preserve unknown keys, like D5).

### 20.3 Per-type option settings (`src/fields/<type>` settings modals)
- The "options settings UI" §7 defers to here. One settings component per field
  type, opened from the fields manager when adding/editing a field:
  - **Number** min/max/step; **Date/DateTime/Time** format + default-as-link;
    **Boolean** none.
  - **Select/Cycle/Multi** values source: inline list editor, a note path, or a
    **base view** (`{ baseFile, viewName }`) chosen with a base-picker
    (`listBaseViews` from the adapter) — replacing MDM's `dvQueryString`.
  - **File/MultiFile/Media/MultiMedia** base-picker + view + `displayColumn` +
    `embed` (Media).
  - **Object/ObjectList** manage child fields (recurse into 20.2 with the child
    `path`).
- Each type's settings component ships next to its value logic in `src/fields/`,
  completing the §7 "each field module ships …" contract.

### 20.4 Entry points & slices
- Reached from the context menu's **Manage fields schema** (§19.3), a command,
  and — on a **fileClass note** — the field indicator itself (§19.4): in the tab
  header / file explorer its icon opens the schema editor instead of the
  note-fields modal.
- Slices: **P2-ter.1** options editor + add/remove/reorder (type+name only);
  **P2-ter.2** per-type settings for Wave A + list sources (base-picker);
  **P2-ter.3** File/Media + Object/ObjectList. Each = code + unit tests (pure
  option (de)serialization, id generation, reorder/hierarchy) + a doc page.
