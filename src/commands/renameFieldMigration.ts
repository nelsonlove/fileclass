/*
 * Renaming a field is a data migration (#108).
 *
 * Renaming a definition used to rewrite the class note and nothing else: every note kept the
 * old key with its value, while the new name had nothing under it — the field read as empty
 * everywhere while its data sat one line above, under a name nothing knew about. Found while
 * recording take 020, where renaming `shelf` to `storage` left `shelf: Study · A-3` in three
 * books.
 *
 * So the rename asks first. This module finds the notes that actually carry the old key,
 * shows them, and rewrites them only on confirmation — one `processFrontMatter` per note,
 * order-preserving (`renameProperty`).

 * feature makes. But saying nothing turns a rename into a column that silently empties, so the
 * modal names the bases that will need a look. A plain text search, deliberately: a base names
 * properties in `order`, in `filters`, in `sort` and inside formulas, and a parser that
 * understood only some of those would miss exactly the ones nobody remembers.
 *
 * The cost of that bluntness is a false positive — renaming `Book.shelf` also names
 * `Comics.base`, which mentions the `shelf` inside Comic's own `storage` object. So the wording
 * points rather than instructs: it says these bases mention the word, and leaves the reader to
 * see whether the column is this field. Claiming otherwise would be worse than saying nothing.
