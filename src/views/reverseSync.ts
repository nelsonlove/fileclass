/*
 * Finding a note's reverse relations and putting one on the page (#154) — the app-facing half.
 *
 * Three impure jobs, in the order the feature performs them:
 *  1. **discover** which relations point at this note, by asking each link field's own source view
 *     whether the note is one of its candidates;
 *  2. **author** the view in the target class's base, once for every host that will ever use it;
 *  3. **place** the embed in the note, at the cursor when there is one.
 *
 * The rules — the filter, the view's name, the reuse test, where an embed already is — are next
 * door in `reverseView.ts`, with the tests. This file only touches Obsidian.

 * author gave `Authors.base#All authors`, a note it does not return is not an author. Results are
 * memoised per (base, view) in `QueryCache`, so ten fields sharing one source view cost one
 * O(vault) scan, and the cache drops on that base's next modify.
 *
 * Root fields only. A link nested inside an `Object` would need a dotted property path in the
