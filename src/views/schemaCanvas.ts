/*
 * The schema canvas (#149): a `.canvas` that mirrors the vault's fileClasses — inheritance,
 * the bases and canvases their fields depend on, and what each class claims.
 *
 * Pure: no `obsidian` import, so every rule here is unit-tested. The caller reads the classes,
 * writes the file, and handles the open-view dance.
 *
 * **The hard part is not layout.** Computing positions on every sync would destroy the
 * arrangement its reader made, which is worse than no diagram at all — so this module never
 * moves a node it recognises. It derives *what* should be there, matches that against the file
 * on disk by **deterministic id**, keeps the geometry of everything already placed, and finds a
 * free slot only for what is new. That is the same promise `mirrorBaseView` makes about a view's
 * filters and `processFrontMatter` about key order.
 *
 * Ids are readable on purpose (`fileclass:Book`, `base:Books.base`) and verified in the app:
 * Obsidian renders them and preserves them through its own saves. Renaming a class therefore
 * yields a new node rather than a renamed one, which is the honest outcome — nothing links the
 * two.
