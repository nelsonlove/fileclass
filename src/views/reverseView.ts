/*
 * The reverse-relation view (#154): from A1, the books whose `author` points at A1.
 *
 * The schema already describes that relation — `Book.author` draws its candidates from
 * `Authors.base#All authors` — but it is only navigable one way. This module authors the view
 * that reads it backwards. **Nothing is evaluated here and nothing is stored**: Fileclass writes
 * a filter, Bases answers it, exactly as with the dependent-field view (#19).
 *
 * Pure: no `obsidian` import, so every rule is unit-tested. The scanning, the file writes and the
 * "is it open in a tab" dance live in `reverseSync.ts`.
 *
 * **One view serves every host.** `this.file` inside an embedded base resolves to the note
 * holding the embed — measured on 1.13.2 and recorded in ARCHITECTURE §3.1 — so A1, A2 and A3
 * embed the *same* view and each sees its own rows. That is why the view's name must not mention
 * a host, and why reuse is the normal path rather than an optimisation.
