/*
 * Draggable modals: grab a modal by its title and move it.
 *
 * Why: a modal is centred, and what it hides is often what you need to look at while
 * filling it in — the note's own properties, the value in the editor behind, a base's
 * rows. Obsidian gives no way to move one, so the title becomes a handle.
 *
 * The offset lives on the modal element as a data attribute rather than in a closure:
 * our modals rebuild their content (and their title) on every render, so a handler
 * attached to a fresh title must find where the modal already is.
 *
 * This module imports nothing from Obsidian, which is what keeps `clampOffset` unit
 * testable — so **the caller decides where dragging applies**. `modalTitle` is that
 * caller, and it excludes mobile: the handle's `touch-action: none` would cost the
 * ability to scroll a modal by dragging its title.

 * setting really is off, not merely half off.
