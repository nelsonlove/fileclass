Fileclass delegates querying and display to the core **Bases** plugin — it does
not ship its own table engine. To see and browse the notes of a fileClass, you
use a `.base` file; Fileclass helps you create one.

## Generating a base

{{< video "032" >}}

Run **Fileclass: create a base for a class**, or **right-click a fileClass
note** → **Create a base for this fileClass**. A small dialog lets you choose:

- the **base file** path (new or existing; defaults to
  `<basesFolder>/<FileClass>.base`, the folder set in **Settings → Fileclass →
  Bases folder**), and
- the **view name** — the managed view (defaults to the fileClass name).

It creates the base — with an **editable `fileclass-table` view** (see below)
listing `file.name` and the fields — and records the choices on the fileClass
(`baseFile`/`baseView`). Pointing at an **existing** base is safe: only the
managed view is added or updated — your other views are left untouched.

**One view, one class.** If another fileClass already mirrors into that file and
view name, the setup says which and stops: two classes writing the same view
would overwrite each other's columns on every sync. Give the second one a view
name of its own — the same base can hold both.

### What the managed view filters on

The filter matches **every way a note can be bound to the class**, not just the
frontmatter property:

- `fileClass.containsAny("Author")` — the note names the class (whatever your
  *fileClass alias* is). `containsAny`, not `==`: a note may carry
  [several classes](../schema/#binding-a-note-to-fileclasses), and the property is
  then a list, which no equality test matches — it was dropping those notes from
  the table of a class they belong to. A base generated before this is still
  recognised as ours, so the next **sync** rewrites the clause;
- `file.inFolder("Authors")` — one clause per **Files paths** folder. `inFolder`
  rather than an equality on the folder, because binding is by prefix: a note in
  `Authors/Deep/` is bound too;
- `file.hasTag("author")` — one clause per **tag name**, and the class name itself
  when *Map with tag* is on.

With more than one of those, they are `or`-ed inside the view's filter group, which
is where a [dependent field](../fields/#conditional-candidates-dependent-fields)
adds its own predicate. A class bound **only by folder or tag** leaves no property
on its notes at all: filtering on the property alone returned an empty view, which
is what a generated base used to do for every folder-mapped class.

Two bindings have no Bases equivalent and are therefore outside the filter:
**bookmark groups**, and a class named by a **Base view**. Notes bound only that
way won't appear in the generated view — add a clause of your own, and sync will
leave it alone.

A base generated before its class gained a folder or a tag is **repaired on the
next sync**, but only when its filter is still exactly what Fileclass wrote. Edit
that filter yourself and it becomes yours: sync then never touches it.

The fileClass filter is written **on the managed view** (Bases' *"This view"*
scope), not base-wide. So you can add a **second view for another fileClass** to
the same base — e.g. a `bookAuthor` view inside your `book` base — and it shows
its own notes instead of being shadowed by a base-wide `fileClass == "book"`
filter. Each view carries its own filter and is free to scope itself.

> **Existing generated bases** created before this change keep their base-wide
> filter — nothing is rewritten silently. To get the per-view behavior there,
> move the filter from *"All views"* to *"This view"* once in the Bases editor,
> or regenerate the base. Sync never moves it for you and never pushes a
> per-view scope back to base-wide.

Once a base exists, the right-click menu on the fileClass note changes:

- **Modify base for this fileClass** — reopens the same dialog (create/sync) on
  the existing base.
- **Open base for this fileClass** — opens the `.base` in a new tab. There's also
  the command **Fileclass: open this class's base**.

## Keeping a base in sync

{{< video "033" >}}

The class note's Properties panel says when a sync is due: its base button reads
**Sync the base** while the managed view no longer mirrors the class, and syncs
in one click. Nothing happens on its own — a base one field behind is a normal
state between a schema change and the moment you decide to carry it over.

A fileClass can **mirror** its fields into a base — **one-way and explicit**, so
your base is never rewritten behind your back. In the schema editor → **Options**,
the **Sync to base** group has:

- **Base file** — the `.base` to mirror into (the generate command fills it in).
- **View name** — the **managed view** inside that base (defaults to the
  fileClass name). Only this view is owned by Fileclass; every other view,
  filter, and sort in the base is yours and is never touched.
- **Base structure** — a status button:
  - **Synced** (disabled) — the managed view matches the fileClass's fields.
  - **Sync** (active) — the base diverged (you edited it, or the fileClass
    changed). Click to re-apply the mirror (`file.name` + the current fields).

Nothing is written automatically: when the fileClass or the base changes, the
status simply flips to **Sync** and waits for you. If the declared base doesn't
exist, **Sync** creates it. There's also a command, **Fileclass: sync this
class to its base**.

> If the base is **open in a tab** when you sync, its layout may not be on disk
> yet (Bases keeps it in memory until the tab closes). Sync detects this and
> offers to **close the tab first** so its state is flushed before mirroring —
> otherwise the sync would read an empty file and do nothing.

> The sync round-trips the YAML, which reformats the file and drops YAML
> comments — fine for the plugin-managed base.

## Editable table view

{{< video "034" >}}

Fileclass registers a Bases view type, **`fileclass-table`**, that renders like a
table but lets you **edit cells in place**: clicking a `note.<field>` cell performs
[that type's gesture](../ui/#one-gesture-per-field-type) — a `Cycle` advances, a
`Boolean` flips, everything else opens the field's typed input (the same one used
everywhere). **Alt-click** always opens the input. `file.*` and `formula.*` cells
stay read-only.

In the view switcher it carries an icon of its own — a table with a small gear,
where the native table is a bare grid — so a base holding both says which is which
without being opened.

Generated bases use it by default. In any other base, set a view's `type` to
`fileclass-table` to get the same editing (the managed view keeps working with
the sync — its type is preserved). It requires the core Bases plugin; with Bases
disabled the view type is simply unavailable (switch the view back to `table`).

The table follows the notes it shows: edit a value in the note, or from its
Properties panel, and the cell changes with it — one set of data, two windows
onto it.

> It renders all rows (no virtualization yet), so very large bases are better
> viewed with a native `table` view.

### A new note from the table

The toolbar's **New** creates a note that already **carries the class**, with its
fields inserted empty, and the row appears at once — Bases applies the view's
filter to what it creates, and the class it names is what a `fileClass` line
would have said. The note opens in a popover whose Properties panel carries this
plugin's [controls](../ui/#property-editor-buttons) like any other, so the row can
be filled in without leaving the table.

### The class's schema, from the table

A table is where a schema shows its consequences — a column too many, a type that
reads wrong in every row. The base's own toolbar therefore carries a wrench:
**Manage `<FileClass>`**, opening that class's [schema editor](../schema/#editing-a-fileclass).

The class is the one that **declared the view** (`baseFile` / `baseView` on the
class note), so `Books.base › Book` is Book's table even when a row is both a
Book and an Article. On a `fileclass-table` view nobody claims — one you set up
by hand — it falls back to the classes of the rows: one and the button names it,
several and it asks which. It appears only on an editable view; switch to a
native one and it goes.

## Validation columns

{{< video "035" >}}

The `fileclass-table` view can prepend a **`valid`** column and append an
**`errors`** column, turning the table into a live data-quality dashboard:

- **`valid`** shows **✓** when every one of the note's fields satisfies its
  schema, or **✗** when at least one does not (missing [required
  fields](../fields/#required-fields), out-of-range numbers, values outside a
  `Select`'s allowed list, malformed dates, …).
- **`errors`** lists the messages for the failing fields (full text on hover).

Validation covers **all** of the note's root fields, not just the columns shown.
Toggle it under **Settings → Fileclass → Validation columns** (on by default).
The same checks back `fileclass validate` on the [CLI](../cli/) and the API's
`validate()`.

It also covers **every note the class claims**, which a filter of your own cannot
do without repeating the bindings: a view filtered on `author.isEmpty()` and the
class property finds the notes that *name* the class, while the column flags the
folder-bound ones too. That is the difference between asking a query and asking
the class.

### Only the rows that need attention

Click the **`valid`** header to see just those, click again for the ones with
nothing to fix, once more for everything. The header carries the count of
failures as it goes (`valid 2✗`), so you know whether it is worth looking before
you look.

It is the column that filters, not a Bases filter
([#142](https://github.com/mdelobelle/fileclass/issues/142)): Bases lets a plugin
register a **view** and nothing else, so validity is not a property its own Sort
and Filter menus can see. Restating the check as a base formula was the
alternative and it was rejected — allowed values are resolved through queries, so
the formula would answer a slightly different question and the two would drift.
The choice lasts for the session; nothing is written to your base.

## The schema canvas

{{< video "039" >}}

A vault's fileClasses form a model — what inherits from what, which fields draw
their values from a `.base`, which are fed by a `.canvas`, and which folders, tags
and bookmark groups each class claims. That model lives in frontmatter spread over
the class notes, which is to say it lives in your head.

**Fileclass: draw the schema canvas** puts it on a canvas — also on the
right-click menu of your class folder.

![A schema canvas: Media above its four children, their binding cards, and the bases and canvas their fields draw from](../schema/schema-canvas.png)

- **one node per class**, carrying a link to its note and **its schema as a table**
  — every field it declares, with its type, and `(N inside)` for an `Object` rather
  than an expansion of it. The link behaves like any link to a class: the icon
  beside it opens the schema editor. Laid out by inheritance — parents above,
  families side by side, classes in no chain stacked on the left;
- an **`extends` edge**, labelled with what the child drops (`− acquired`), capped
  at three names plus a count;
- a **`.base` file node** per base feeding a field — a real preview of it, so the
  table you depend on is right there — edged `candidates` for a
  `File`/`Media` field and `values` for a `Select`/`Cycle`/`Multi` values source —
  the same relation, said twice because it is two mechanisms;
- a **`.canvas` node** per canvas feeding a [Canvas field](../fields/#canvas-fields-canvas--canvasgroup--canvasgrouplink);
- a **claim card** per binding kind, listing what the class claims. A tag that
  cannot bind is struck through with the reason — the index skips any tag with a
  space in it, so a class named `Media Item` with *Map with tag* on claims
  **nothing**, and nothing else in Obsidian says so.

### The layout is yours

The canvas is generated once and **arranged by you**. A sync afterwards keeps the
geometry of every node it recognises — position, size, colour, a card's box even
as its text is rewritten — adds what is new in a free slot, drops what the classes
no longer justify, and never touches a node you added yourself.

It is **explicit**, like [keeping a base in sync](#keeping-a-base-in-sync) and
unlike the Canvas engine: a file you have arranged by hand is not one to rewrite
unasked. Run the command again and it reports what changed, or tells you the
canvas already matches your classes. If the canvas is open, it is written through
the open view, so the diagram redraws and there is nothing to close.

Where it lives: **Settings → Fileclass → Schema canvas**, or
`<class folder>/Schema.canvas` by default.

## Embedding

{{< video "036" >}}

Embed any base in a note the way Obsidian does it — no Fileclass code block is
involved:

- **`![[Some.base]]`** embeds a base file, on its first view;
- a **` ```base `** code block holds a base defined inline, in the note itself.

An embedded **`fileclass-table`** is the same table as in its own tab: the cells
take the same gestures, the `valid` column counts and filters, and the wrench in
its toolbar opens the class. A note can hold several, each with its own toolbar.

A dashboard note is then just a note: headings, prose, and the tables the classes
already describe.

## The other end of a relation

`Book.author` takes its candidates from `Authors.base`. From a book you reach its
author in one click — and from the author you reach nothing, even though the
schema describes that relation completely. **Insert notes that point here**, from
the command palette or a note's right-click menu, closes the loop:

![An author note in reading mode: its properties, its prose, and a table of the books whose author it is](../reverse/reverse-relation.png)

Fileclass writes a **view** into a base and embeds it. Nothing is evaluated and
nothing is stored: the table is Bases answering a filter, live.

### One view serves every note

The view is called **`Book by author`** — the class and the field, never the note
you ran it from. Inside an embedded base, `this.file` is the note **holding the
embed**, so the same view shows each author their own books. The first author to
ask creates it; every author after that only gets the embed, and a base does not
end up with four hundred near-identical views.

Because the view is shared, it is also yours to keep: run the command again and
Fileclass reuses what it finds, with whatever columns, sort and filter you have
given it since.

### You choose where it lives

The first run asks, offering the target class's own base — `Books.base` for a
`Book by author`. Point it anywhere instead: an existing base gets one more view,
a new path is created. Nothing is put in your vault without being named first, and
a vault does not grow a `.base` per class that happens to be pointed at.

From the second note onwards nothing is asked. Fileclass finds the view **by its
name**, in whichever base you put it, so a relation you sent to a dashboard base
stays there — one view, one copy.

### What the filter says

Two clauses: the class's own scope — property, folders and tags, exactly as in
[a managed view](#what-the-managed-view-filters-on) — and the relation itself,
`author == this.file.asLink()`, or `contributors.contains(this.file.asLink())`
when the field holds several links.

It compares **links**, not names. So an aliased link (`[[Frank Herbert|Herbert]]`)
still matches, and two authors who share a basename in different folders keep
their own books apart.

The columns come from the class's own table when it has one — trim your Book table
to five columns and the reverse table arrives with the same five, wherever you send
it. The pointing field is left out: down this table it holds the host note on every
row.

### Where the embed goes

At the **cursor** when the note is open in edit mode, appended at the end
otherwise. If an embed of that view is already in the note, Fileclass takes you to
it rather than adding a second one, and never rewrites the one that is there.

### What it can read backwards

A field qualifies when it holds links (`File`, `MultiFile`, `Media`,
`MultiMedia`) **and** draws its candidates from a base view — that binding is what
declares the relation. So:

- a `Select` holding an author's name is not a relation: nothing resolves it to a
  file, and no filter over it could survive a rename;
- a link field with no base binding accepts any note in the vault, which would
  make every class a candidate from every note;
- links nested inside an `Object` are out of scope.

Discovery asks each source view whether this note is one of its candidates, which
is a scan of the vault per view. It runs only when you invoke the command — never
on opening a note — and views shared by several fields are asked once.
