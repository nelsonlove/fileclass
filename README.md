# Fileclass

**Give your notes typed, validated properties with guided input — define
reusable note types, like a schema for your frontmatter.**

You define reusable **note types** (called *fileClasses*), each with a fixed set
of typed fields. For example, a **Book** type where `author` must be a link to a
Person note, `status` is one of *Reading* / *Read* / *Abandoned*, and `rating`
is a number from 1 to 5. Every note of that type then gets **guided input** for
those fields (dropdowns, date pickers, link autocomplete), and Fileclass flags
any note where a field is missing or has the wrong type.

In short: a **schema and input forms for your frontmatter**. You define the
fields and fill them in; the core **Bases** plugin queries and displays them. If
you have used Notion databases or Metadata Menu, it is that idea — but
**frontmatter-only**, with **no Dataview dependency**.

properties by hand to a typed library, install and setup included:

Then one short video per feature, a couple of minutes each:
[the whole series](https://mdelobelle.github.io/fileclass/videos/).

It is the successor to [Metadata Menu](https://github.com/mdelobelle/metadatamenu)
(same author). If you rely on Dataview inline fields (`key:: value`), stay on
Metadata Menu; Fileclass is frontmatter-only.

## Why Fileclass

Metadata Menu used **Dataview** to feed field values — the allowed values or file
candidates for a `Select`/`File` field came from a DataviewJS query. Obsidian now
ships its own query engine, **Bases**, so Fileclass uses that instead: you point a
field at a `.base` view, and the notes/values that view returns become the
field's candidates. Field-value filtering runs entirely on core Obsidian.

- **No Dataview dependency**, lighter bundle.
- **Frontmatter-only** — reads via the metadata cache, writes via
  `processFrontMatter`; note text is never parsed or edited.
- **Rebuilt with quality & security in mind** — full unit-test coverage,
  TypeScript strict.
- **Your existing fileClass definitions work as-is** — the Metadata Menu format
  is unchanged.

## Features

- **fileClasses**: typed schemas with inheritance (`extends` / `excludes`),
  bound by alias, tag, path, bookmark group, Base view, or a global default.
- **Typed fields**: Input, Number, Boolean, Select, Cycle, Multi, Date/DateTime/
  Time, File/MultiFile, Media/MultiMedia, Object/ObjectList, JSON/YAML, and
  Canvas fields — with guided input everywhere (modal, native Properties editor,
  context menus, indicators).
- **Data quality**: required fields and per-note validation, surfaced in the
  table view and via the CLI/API.
- **Views**: generate a `.base` for a fileClass and keep it in one-way sync;
  an editable **`fileclass-table`** Bases view with in-cell typed editing.
- **Terminal**: a public plugin **API** (on the plugin instance), plus a
  standalone **CLI** and interactive **TUI** — in their own repo,
  [fileclass-cli](https://github.com/mdelobelle/fileclass-cli) — to inspect,
  validate and edit typed frontmatter from the command line.

## Requirements

- Obsidian **1.12.7+** with the core **Bases** plugin enabled.
- Schema and typed input work without Bases; query-dependent features
  (File/Media candidates, generated views) require it. They rely on Bases
  internals validated on 1.13.2; on older versions they degrade gracefully rather
  than erroring.

## Installation

**Settings → Community plugins → Browse**, search for **Fileclass**, install and
enable it. Then point it at a folder for your class notes — the first minute of
[Tour #1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rScC86I2vlg) does exactly that.

To install a build by hand instead, copy `main.js`, `manifest.json` and
`styles.css` from the [latest release](https://github.com/mdelobelle/fileclass/releases)
into `<your-vault>/.obsidian/plugins/fileclass/`, then reload Obsidian.

## Coming from Metadata Menu

Your fileClass notes are read as-is. Two things changed:

- **`Lookup` and `Formula` are out of scope** — use Bases views for reverse
  relations and computed columns. Existing ones load read-only.
- **The old FileClassView is replaced by `fileclass-table`** — a Bases view with
  editable cells.

> Metadata Menu still works, but **don't run both at the same time**. It is in
> maintenance mode and won't receive further features.
