# Demo series roadmap

One take per atomic feature, ordered so a take only needs what earlier takes
already showed. The budget is **60 seconds of narration**, which lands a finished
video between two and three minutes depending on how much typing it asks for — see
[SCENARIO.md](SCENARIO.md#budget-60-seconds-of-narration-plus-the-typing-tax).
All subtitles are in English — non-English speakers turn on YouTube's captions.

How to use this list: pick the next unrecorded take, propose its step list, get it
approved, then write `NNN_*/scenario.yaml` + `demo-vault/` (see
[SCENARIO.md](SCENARIO.md)). New features get a take of their own, proposed with
the feature itself — that's a rule in the repo's `CLAUDE.md`, and the take doubles
as the manual smoke test.

`Formula` and `Lookup` are absent: out of the plugin's scope. The CLI has no take
either — driving a terminal with burned-in subtitles isn't tooling we have, and
its audience reads the docs. "Coming from Metadata Menu" and "which level of
normalization" belong in a GitHub discussion thread, not in a video.

## Tour

One take before the arcs, and the only one that shows the whole plugin end to end.

| # | Take | Feature | Vault gains | Status |
| - | ---- | ------- | ----------- | ------ |
| 000 | Tour #1 — from an untyped vault to a typed library | install, class folder, a class bound by folder, `File` candidates narrowed by another field | untyped library + `Authors/` + `Authors.base` | ✅ [published](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rScC86I2vlg) |

It is deliberately the exception to the 60-second rule (~5 min), and it can only be
recorded once the store carries the release with #19 — the install happens on camera.

## The cast

The vault is a media library, and it's the *same* library across the whole
series — a class introduced in one take is the one queried three takes later.
Recurring material, all of it widely known:

| Kind | Notes |
| ---- | ----- |
| Books | *Dune* (Frank Herbert, Chilton Books, 1965), *The Lord of the Rings* (J.R.R. Tolkien, Allen & Unwin, 1954) |
| Comics | *Tintin in Tibet* (Hergé, Casterman, 1960) |
| Albums | *Kind of Blue* (Miles Davis, Columbia, 1959) |
| Articles | *As We May Think* (Vannevar Bush, The Atlantic, 1945) |
| People | Frank Herbert, J.R.R. Tolkien, Hergé, Miles Davis, Vannevar Bush |
| Classes | `Media` (parent), `Book`, `Comic`, `Album`, `Article`, `Author`, `Artist`, `Activity` |

## Arc 2 — the simple types

One take per type: a minute each, exactly what someone asks for in a support
thread, and a tight smoke test of that type's input path.

| # | Take | Feature | Vault gains | Status |
| - | ---- | ------- | ----------- | ------ |

## Arc 4 — the richer types

| # | Take | Feature | Vault gains | Status |
| - | ---- | ------- | ----------- | ------ |
| 016 | Templated input | `Input` template (`{{placeholder}}`) | `Book.shelf` | ✅ [published](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmUgluPZal0) |

| 021 | A list of grouped fields | `ObjectList`, display template | `Book.editions` | ✅ [published](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHIVXu8LiEE) |

## Arc 5 — modelling a class

| # | Take | Feature | Vault gains | Status |
| - | ---- | ------- | ----------- | ------ |
| 023 | Fields you can't leave empty | required fields | `Book.author` required, James Clear | ✅ [published](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7F5BvcUbUAc) |

| 025 | Two classes on one note | multiple binding, global class, alias | `Article` class | |
| 025b | Notes a class claims by itself | `Map with tag`, `Tag names`, `Files paths`, `Bookmark groups` — the bindings that type a note without a word in its frontmatter. The take also carries [#121](https://github.com/mdelobelle/fileclass/issues/121): the three lists picked from the vault's own tags, folders and bookmark groups instead of typed | a `Reading list/` folder bound by path, `#album` notes, a bookmark group | |

## Arc 6 — filling fields fast

| # | Take | Feature | Vault gains | Status |
| - | ---- | ------- | ----------- | ------ |
| 026 | Every field of a note, one modal | note-fields modal | — | |
| 027 | Right-click your way through it | context menus | — | |
| 028 | Edit buttons in the properties panel | property edit buttons | — | |
| 029 | Seeing at a glance what's typed | field indicators (tab, explorer, links, bases) | — | |
| 030 | Change one field across a whole class | bulk edit (set-where) | — | |
| 030b | Renaming a field, and every note that carries it | rename with frontmatter migration ([#108](https://github.com/mdelobelle/fileclass/issues/108)) — a Save of its own, listing the notes it will rewrite | `Book.shelf` → `storage` | |
| 031 | New notes that arrive already typed | Templater / Templates | a Book template | |

## Arc 7 — Bases views

| # | Take | Feature | Vault gains | Status |
| - | ---- | ------- | ----------- | ------ |
| 032 | A table for a class, generated | `Create a base for a class` | `Book.base` | |
| 033 | Schema changed? the base follows | `Sync this class to its base` | — | |
| 034 | Editing right in the table | `fileclass-table` view | — | |
| 035 | What's missing, in a column | validation columns | — | |
| 036 | A base inside a note | embedding | a dashboard note | |

## Arc 8 — canvas and settings

| # | Take | Feature | Vault gains | Status |
| - | ---- | ------- | ----------- | ------ |
| 037 | A field that follows your canvas | `Canvas` | a reading-map canvas | |
| 038 | Groups on a canvas as data | `CanvasGroup`, `CanvasGroupLink` | — | |
| 039 | The settings, one pass | behaviour toggles, indicators, defaults | — | |

**41 takes** (39 numbered, plus `010b` and `016b` — facets that earned their own
take), roughly 50 minutes of finished video.
