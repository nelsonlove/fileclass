# Demo series roadmap

One take per atomic feature, ordered so a take only needs what earlier takes
already showed. The budget is **60 seconds of narration**, which lands a finished
video between two and three minutes depending on how much typing it asks for — see
[SCENARIO.md](SCENARIO.md#budget-60-seconds-of-narration-plus-the-typing-tax).
All subtitles are in English — non-English speakers turn on YouTube's captions.

How to use this list: pick the next unrecorded take, propose its step list, get it
approved, then write `NNN_*/scenario.yaml` + `demo-vault/` (see
[SCENARIO.md](SCENARIO.md)). New features get a take of their own, proposed with
the feature itself — that's a rule in the repo's `CLAUDE.md`, and the take doubles
as the manual smoke test.

`Formula` and `Lookup` are absent: out of the plugin's scope. The CLI has no take
either — driving a terminal with burned-in subtitles isn't tooling we have, and
its audience reads the docs. "Coming from Metadata Menu" and "which level of
normalization" belong in a GitHub discussion thread, not in a video.

## Tour

One take before the arcs, and the only one that shows the whole plugin end to end.

| # | Take | Feature | Vault gains | Status |
| - | ---- | ------- | ----------- | ------ |
| 000 | Tour #1 — from an untyped vault to a typed library | install, class folder, a class bound by folder, `File` candidates narrowed by another field | untyped library + `Authors/` + `Authors.base` | ✅ [published](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rScC86I2vlg) |

It is deliberately the exception to the 60-second rule (~5 min), and it can only be
recorded once the store carries the release with #19 — the install happens on camera.

## The cast

The vault is a media library, and it's the *same* library across the whole
series — a class introduced in one take is the one queried three takes later.
Recurring material, all of it widely known:

| Kind | Notes |
| ---- | ----- |
| Books | *Dune* (Frank Herbert, Chilton Books, 1965), *The Lord of the Rings* (J.R.R. Tolkien, Allen & Unwin, 1954) |
| Comics | *Tintin in Tibet* (Hergé, Casterman, 1960) |
| Albums | *Kind of Blue* (Miles Davis, Columbia, 1959) |
| Articles | *As We May Think* (Vannevar Bush, The Atlantic, 1945) |
| People | Frank Herbert, J.R.R. Tolkien, Hergé, Miles Davis, Vannevar Bush |
| Classes | `Media` (parent), `Book`, `Comic`, `Album`, `Article`, `Author`, `Artist`, `Activity` |

## Arc 2 — the simple types

One take per type: a minute each, exactly what someone asks for in a support
thread, and a tight smoke test of that type's input path.

## Arc 5 — modelling a class

## Arc 6 — filling fields fast

| # | Take | Feature | Vault gains | Status |
| - | ---- | ------- | ----------- | ------ |
| 026 | Every field of a note, one modal | note-fields modal: rows, Alt on the type icon, Clear, the keyboard grid, and the four things in its footer | — (it works on the vault as 025b leaves it) | ✅ [published](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rd7VeYbHsrE) |
| 027 | Right-click your way through it | context menus on a note, in its text, on its tab, on a class note and on the class folder | — (works on the vault as 026 leaves it) | ✅ [published](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqxv7Wrxer8) |
| 028 | Buttons where you already edit | property edit buttons: one per typed row, the wrench on `fileClass`, the section actions, and Alt or right-click to edit the field itself | — (works on the vault as 027 leaves it) | ✅ [published](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ope7-S5hL94) |
| 029 | Seeing at a glance what's typed | field indicators on all six surfaces — tab, explorer, links, backlinks, bookmarks, bases — and what each one opens | — (works on the vault as 028 leaves it) | ✅ [published](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA4KadPjbNg) |
| 030 | One field across a whole class | bulk edit (set-where): the four questions, the counted preview, and Apply carrying its number | — (works on the vault as 029 leaves it) | ✅ [published](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRtYZ3lCy5c) |
| 030b | Renaming a field, and every note that carries it | rename with frontmatter migration ([#108](https://github.com/mdelobelle/fileclass/issues/108)) — a Save of its own, the notes listed before the write, and the bases it will not touch | `Book.shelf` → `storage` | ✅ [published](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJAqxSDIXac) |

| 031 | New notes that arrive already typed | Templates: the class written into a template on camera, the fields baked in once, and what a schema change does not do | `Templates/` with *New book* and *Daily note*, both classless | ✅ [published](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uNtXbPQ-0M) |

## Arc 7 — Bases views

| # | Take | Feature | Vault gains | Status |
| - | ---- | ------- | ----------- | ------ |
| 032 | A table for a class, generated | `Create a base for a class`: the modal, the columns in class order, the class↔base link, and a view added to a base you already keep | `Habit.base`, plus a fifth view in `Books.base` | ✅ [published](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGG3ONU4sv8) |
| 033 | Schema changed? the base follows | `Sync this class to its base`, and the base button that reads *Sync the base* while the class and its table disagree | — (works on the vault as 032 leaves it) | ✅ [published](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wnt_FkyFd8I) |
| 034 | Editing right in the table | `fileclass-table`: a cell per field, each keeping its type's gesture, the Bases toolbar with its typed *New*, and the wrench that opens the class | — (opens on `Habit.base`, as 033 leaves it) | ✅ [published](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQTOTgjfuKs) |
| 035 | What's missing, in a column | validation columns: three kinds of failure, the count in the header, and the filter it carries ([#142](https://github.com/mdelobelle/fileclass/issues/142)) | — (opens on `Books.base` › *Book*, as 034 leaves it) | ✅ [published](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qNflzfclNI) |
| 036 | A base inside a note | embedding: `![[x.base]]` and a `base` block, both editable, each with its own toolbar | a dashboard note, written on camera | ✅ [published](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6I9YZNaoqnc) |

## Arc 8 — canvas and settings

| # | Take | Feature | Vault gains | Status |
| - | ---- | ------- | ----------- | ------ |
| 037 | A field that follows your canvas | `Canvas`: the graph as a source, the engine writing by itself, and the filters that narrow it | `Reading map.canvas` (six books, four edges) | ✅ [published](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeccqChw1kA) |
| 038 | Groups on a canvas as data | `CanvasGroup`, `CanvasGroupLink`: the box a note sits in, what the box is wired to, and geometry as the rule | two groups on `Reading map.canvas`, and the activity one of them feeds | ✅ [published](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smt6cu8PLnE) |
| 039 | The model your classes make | the schema canvas ([#149](https://github.com/mdelobelle/fileclass/issues/149)): every class with its fields, inheritance, the bases and canvases they depend on, what each claims — and an arrangement that survives a resync | `Classes/Schema.canvas` | ✅ [published](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp6jflaZwj0) |

**44 takes published**, 109 minutes of finished video — the whole series, arcs 1
to 8. Numbered 000 to 039, with `010b`, `016b`, `025b`, `030b` and `030c` as facets
that earned their own take.

What is deliberately not filmed, gathered in one place: `Formula` and `Lookup`
(outside the plugin's scope), the CLI (a terminal under burned-in subtitles is not
tooling we have, and its audience reads), the **settings tab** (a tab that describes
itself row by row, with [a page](https://mdelobelle.github.io/fileclass/settings/)
that says the rest — a film of twelve toggles teaches nothing a reader cannot get
faster by scrolling), and "coming from Metadata Menu" (a discussion thread, not a
video).
